**Chatify ChatRoom:**

Installation Notes: We used express for this project, so our HTML, CSS, and client side JS are in the public folder. In addition, there are some required files in the public folder.

Creative Portion: 

1. Transfer Admin Privledges. Initially, the room creator will hold admin privledges (to kick and ban) and will retain this privledges so long the room exists. However, if they so choose, they can transfer admin privledges to another user in the room. Then that user will become the admin, and will have powers of kick, ban, and/or admin transfer.
2. Unban feature. On the admin panel, there is a "ban list" button, that when clicked, will show a list of banned users (if there are any). Then the admin can click on the user and the user will be removed from the  ban list. Then the user will be able to rejoin the room as a normal user. 
3. Text Message Position. Text messages that you send will appear in a dark brown on the right of the chatbox. Text messages recieved from other users or the server will appear in a lighter color on the left side of the chatbox. 
4. Messages from the Server when a user is kicked, leaves, banned, joins, or is made admin.
